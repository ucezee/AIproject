# Healthcare Translation Web App with Generative AI

## Project Overview

Develop a web-based prototype that enables real-time, multilingual translation between patients and healthcare providers. This application should convert spoken input into text, provide a live transcript, and offer a translated version with audio playback. The project will assess your technical proficiency, speed, and use of generative AI for efficient development.

## Core Functionalities

- **Voice-to-Text with Generative AI**: Convert spoken input into a text transcript, using AI to enhance transcription accuracy, especially for medical terms.
- **Real-Time Translation and Audio Playback**: Provide real-time translation of the transcript with a "Speak" button for audio playback.
- **Mobile-First Design**: Ensure the app is responsive and optimized for mobile and desktop use.

## User Interface and Experience

- **Dual Transcript Display**: Show both original and translated transcripts in real-time.
- **Speak Button**: Accessible for audio playback of translated text.
- **Language Selection**: Allow users to choose input and output languages easily.

## Technical Requirements

- **Generative AI Tools**: Use generative AI (e.g., OpenAI API or similar) for both translation and coding assistance.
- **Speech Recognition API**: Integrate a speech recognition API (e.g., Web Speech API or Google Speech-to-Text).
- **Deployment Platform**: Deploy on a platform like Vercel, V0, or Cursor. Provide a live link.
- **Data Privacy and Security**: Ensure patient confidentiality with basic security measures.

## Testing and Quality Assurance

- Ensure transcription, translation, and audio playback functions work as intended.
- Include error handling for transcription or translation failures.

## Deliverables

- **Prototype Link**: Submit a live, accessible link to the deployed web app.
- **Code Documentation**: Outline the code structure, AI tools, and security considerations.
- **User Guide**: A brief guide to using the app’s features.
- **Presentation (Optional)**: An explanation of your approach and how generative AI was used.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Technical Skill**: Efficient use of generative AI for both translation and coding, and quality of the codebase.
- **User Experience**: An intuitive, mobile-compatible interface.
- **Adaptability and Speed**: Ability to complete the project within 48 hours.
- **Problem-Solving**: Handling of medical terminology and security in healthcare.
